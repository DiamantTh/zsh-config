My ZSH config

 bin/_git from https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.zsh
 
 bin/_hub from  https://github.com/github/hub/blob/master/etc/hub.zsh_completion
 
 dir_colors Scheme from https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord-dircolors

Customized for me.

  **Old Text**
	
	$ This is my ZSH config. As I hate to reinvent wheels (OK, and I'm lazy), I took [William Durands](git@github.com:willdurand/zsh-config.git) 
	$ configuration and stripped that down to my own preferences. All credits to him! 

Installation
------------

     git clone git@github.com:DiamantTh/zsh-config.git --recursive
     cd zsh-config && bin/install
